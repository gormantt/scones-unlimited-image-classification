# scones-unlimited-image-classification
In this project I deploy a CNN using an AWS Endpoint and then invoke the endpoint using a combination of lambda functions and a step function.

The main code is contained in "starter.ipynb".

Lambda Function code is in "lambda.py".

Step function info is in "step_function_execution-detail.json"

Then two screenshots, "successfull_run_screenshot.png" and "does_not_meet_confidence.png",  show the step function operation.
